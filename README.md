# Insider
# In$ider is a website that tracks high-level government officialsâ€™ trades and provides stock advice. The core principle of In$ider is that members of the federal government frequently use insider information to make enormous profits off of the stock market. In$ider is designed to bridge this disadvantage and give the general public the opportunity to also cash in. The application centralizes official government released information and assigns scores based on each politician's trade successes with rankings to help users get what they need quickly and without any unnecessary steps.
